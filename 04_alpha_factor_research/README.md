# Chapter 04: Financial Feature Engineering: How to research Alpha Factors

Alpha factors aim to predict the price movements of assets in the investment universe based on the available market, fundamental, or alternative data. A factor may combine one or several input variables, but assumes a single value for each asset every time the strategy evaluates the factor. 

Trade decisions typically rely on relative values across assets. Trading strategies are often based on signals emitted by multiple factors, and we will see that machine learning (ML) models are particularly well suited to integrate the various signals efficiently to make more accurate predictions.

This chapter provides a framework for understanding how factors work and how to measure their performance, for example using the information coefficient (IC). It demonstrates how to engineer alpha factors from data using Python libraries offline and on the Quantopian platform. It also introduces the `zipline` library to backtest factors and the `alphalens` library to evaluate their predictive power. More specifically, this chapter covers:

- Which categories of factors exist, why they work and how to measure them
- How to create alpha factors using numpy, pandas, and talib
- How to denoise data using wavelets and the Kalman filter
- How to use zipline offline and on Quantopian to test individual and multiple alpha factors
- How the information coefficient (IC) measures an alpha factor's predictive performance
- How to use alphalens to evaluate predictive performance and turnover using, among other metrics, the information coefficient (IC)

## Alpha Factors in practice: from data to signals

Alpha factors are transformations of market, fundamental, and alternative data that contain predictive signals. They are designed to capture risks that drive asset returns. One set of factors describes fundamental, economy-wide variables such as growth, inflation, volatility, productivity, and demographic risk. Another set consists of tradeable investment styles such as the market portfolio, value-growth investing, and momentum investing.

There are also factors that explain price movements based on the economics or institutional setting of financial markets, or investor behavior, including known biases of this behavior. The economic theory behind factors can be rational, where the factors have high returns over the long run to compensate for their low returns during bad times, or behavioral, where factor risk premiums result from the possibly biased, or not entirely rational behavior of agents that is not arbitraged away.

### On the shoulders of giants: meet the factor establishment

In an idealized world, categories of risk factors should be independent of each other (orthogonal), yield positive risk premia, and form a complete set that spans all dimensions of risk and explains the systematic risks for assets in a given class. In practice, these requirements will hold only approximately.

## From signals to trades: backtesting with `zipline`

The open source [zipline](http://www.zipline.io/index.html) library is an event-driven backtesting system maintained and used in production by the crowd-sourced quantitative investment fund [Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com/) to facilitate algorithm-development and live-trading. It automates the algorithm's reaction to trade events and provides it with current and historical point-in-time data that avoids look-ahead bias.

### Installation

- The current release 1.3 has a few shortcomings such as the [dependency on benchmark data from the IEX exchange](https://github.com/quantopian/zipline/issues/2480) and limitations for importing features beyond the basic OHLCV data points.
- To enable the use of `zipline`, I've provided a [patched version](https://github.com/stefan-jansen/zipline) that works for the purposes of this book.
    - Create a virtual environment based on Python 3.5, for instance using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
    - After activating the virtual environment, run `pip install -U pip Cython`
    - Install the patched `zipline` version by cloning the repo, `cd` into the packages' root folder and run `pip install -e`
    - Run `pip install jupyter pyfolio`
