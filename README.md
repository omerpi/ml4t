# Machine Learning for Algorithmic Trading using Python

The book provides a comprehensive introduction to how ML can add value to the design and execution of algorithmic trading strategies. It is organized in four parts that cover different aspects of the data sourcing and strategy development process, as well as different solutions to various ML challenges.

## Part 1: How to Design a Trading Strategy

The first part provides a framework for the development of trading strategies driven by machine learning (ML). It focuses on the data that power the ML algorithms and strategies discussed in this book, outlines how ML can be used to derive trading signals, and how to deploy and evaluate strategies as part of a portfolio.

### 01 Machine Learning for Trading

This [chapter](01_machine_learning_for_trading) summarizes how and why ML became central to investment, describes the trading process and outlines how ML can add value. It covers:

- How to read this book
- The rise of ML in the Investment Industry 
- Design and execution of a trading strategy
- ML and algorithmic trading strategies: use cases

### 02: Market & Fundamental Data

This [chapter](02_market_and_fundamental_data) introduces market and fundamental data sources and the environment in which they are created. Familiarity with various types of orders and the trading infrastructure matters because they affect backtest simulations of a trading strategy. We also illustrate how to use Python to access and work with trading and financial statement data. 

In particular, this chapter will cover the following topics:
- How market microstructure shapes market data
- How to reconstruct the order book from tick data using Nasdaq ITCH 
- How to summarize tick data using various time, volume and dollar bars
- How to work with eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL)-encoded electronic filings
- How to parse and combine market and fundamental data to create a P/E series
- How to access various market and fundamental data sources using Python


### 03: Alternative Data for Finance

This [chapter](02_market_and_fundamental_data) outlines categories and describes criteria to assess the exploding number of alternative data sources and providers. It also demonstrates how to create alternative data sets by scraping websites, for example to collect earnings call transcripts for use with natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis algorithms in the second part of the book. More specifically, this chapter covers:

- How the alternative data revolution has unleashed new sources of information
- How individuals, business processes, and sensors generate alternative data
- How to evaluate the proliferating supply of alternative data used for algorithmic trading
- How to work with alternative data in Python, such as by scraping the internet
- Important categories and providers of alternative data

### 04: Research & Evaluation of Alpha Factors

[Chapter 4](04_alpha_factor_research) provides a framework for understanding how factors work and how to measure their performance, for example using the information coefficient (IC). It demonstrates how to engineer alpha factors from data using Python libraries offline and on the Quantopian platform. It also introduces the `zipline` library to backtest factors and the `alphalens` library to evaluate their predictive power. More specifically, this chapter covers:

- How to characterize, justify and measure key types of alpha factors
- How to create alpha factors using financial feature engineering
- How to use `zipline` offline to test individual alpha factors
- How to use `zipline` on Quantopian to combine alpha factors and identify more sophisticated signals
- How the information coefficient (IC) measures an alpha factor's predictive performance
- How to use `alphalens` to evaluate predictive performance and turnover
 

### 05: Strategy Evaluation & Portfolio Management

Testing a strategy requires simulating the portfolios generated by an algorithm to verify its performance under market conditions. Strategy evaluation includes backtesting against historical data to optimize the strategy's parameters, and forward-testing to validate the in-sample performance against new, out-of-sample data and avoid false discoveries from tailoring a strategy to specific past circumstances. This [chapter](05_strategy_evaluation) introduces several approaches to optimizing portfolios that include the application of machine learning (ML) to learn hierarchical relationships among assets. 

More specifically, in this [chapter](05_strategy_evaluation), we cover 
- How to build and test a portfolio based on alpha factors using zipline
- How to measure portfolio risk and return
- How to evaluate portfolio performance using pyfolio
- How to manage portfolio weights using mean-variance optimization and alternatives
- How to use machine learning to optimize asset allocation in a portfolio context
