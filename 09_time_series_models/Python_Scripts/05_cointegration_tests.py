# # Cointegration Tests & Pairs Trading

# ## What is cointegration?
# We have seen how a time series can have a unit root that creates a stochastic trend and makes the time series highly persistent. When we use such an integrated time series in their original, rather than in differenced, form as a feature in a linear regression model, its relationship with the outcome will often appear statistically significant, even though it is not. This phenomenon is called spurious regression (for details, see Chapter 18 in [Wooldridge, 2008](https://economics.ut.ac.ir/documents/3030266/14100645/Jeffrey_M._Wooldridge_Introductory_Econometrics_A_Modern_Approach__2012.pdf)). Therefore, the recommended solution is to difference the time series so they become stationary before using them in a model.
# 
# However, there is an exception when there are cointegration relationships between the outcome and one or more input variables. To understand the concept of cointegration, let's first remember that the residuals of a regression model are a linear combination of the inputs and the output series.
# 
# Usually, the residuals of the regression of one integrated time series on one or more such series yields non-stationary residuals that are also integrated, and thus behave like a random walk. However, for some time series, this is not the case: the regression produces coefficients that yield a linear combination of the time series in the form of the residuals that are stationary, even though the individual series are not. Such time series are
# cointegrated.
# 
# A non-technical example is that of a drunken man on a random walk accompanied by his dog (on a leash). Both trajectories are non-stationary but cointegrated because the dog will occasionally revert to his owner. In the trading context, arbitrage constraints imply cointegration between spot and futures prices.
# 
# In other words, a linear combination of two or more cointegrated series has a stable mean to which this linear combination reverts. This also applies when the individual series are integrated of a higher order and the linear combination reduces the overall order of integration.
# 
# Cointegration differs from correlation: two series can be highly correlated but need not be cointegrated. For example, if two growing series are constant multiples of each other, their correlation will be high, but any linear combination will also grow rather than revert to a stable mean.

# ## Cointegration for Pairs Trading
# 
# Cointegration is very useful: if two or more asset price series tend to revert to a common mean, we can leverage deviations from the trend because they should imply future price moves in the opposite direction. The mathematics behind cointegration is more involved, so we will only focus on the practical aspects; for an in-depth treatment, see [Lütkepohl (2005)](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540401728).
# 
# In this notebook, we will address how we can identify pairs with such a long-term stationary relationship, estimate the expected time for any disequilibrium to correct, and how to utilize these tools to implement and backtest a long-short pairs trading strategy. There are two approaches to testing for cointegration:
# - The Engle-Granger two-step method
# - The Johansen test
# 
# The book chapter discusses each test in turn; in this notebook we show how they help identify cointegrated securities that tend to revert to a common trend, a fact that we can leverage for a statistical arbitrage
# strategy.

# Clearly, cointegration tests are significantly more costly. It would be great if the heuristics worked just as well, or at least 'good enough'.

# ### Compute Heuristics

# The function `compute_pair_metrics()` computes the following distance metrics for over 23,000 pairs of
# stocks and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) for 2010-14 and 2015-19:
# 
# - The **drift of the spread**, defined as a linear regression of a time trend on the spread
# - The spread's  **volatility**
# - The **correlations** between the normalized price series and between their returns
# 
# Low drift and volatility, as well as high correlation, are simple proxies for cointegration. 
# 
# To evaluate the predictive power of these heuristics, we also run Engle-Granger and Johansen **cointegration tests** using `statsmodels` for the preceding pairs. This takes place in the loop in the second half of `compute_pair_metrics()`.
# 
# We first estimate the optimal number of lags that we need to specify for the Johansen test. For both tests, we assume that the cointegrated series (the spread) may have an intercept different from zero but no trend:

# ### How well do the heuristics predict significant cointegration?

A decision tree does slightly better at AUC=0.821, with or without the correlation features.
